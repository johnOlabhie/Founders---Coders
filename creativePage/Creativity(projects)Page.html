            <ol>
                <li> Collaboration takes centre stage in my journey, as evidenced by the Parents' Evening Management System developed in Java. Working harmoniously with a team of eight, we designed a comprehensive solution that streamlined the complex task of organising and managing parent-teacher interactions during school events. This collaborative effort underscores my ability to contribute effectively within a group dynamic.</li>

              <li><h3>Vitural Reality project(Unity)/Bender 3d</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Independently, I delve into the realm of 3D modeling using Blender. This creative outlet allows me to bring virtual concepts to life, infusing a sense of realism into my projects. These meticulously crafted 3D models find their purpose in my ongoing Unity VR application project, "Mind Space." This innovative endeavor aims to create a virtual fine motor skills development app, leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR technology to provide users with a unique and engaging experience.</li>

               <li><h3>Android Studio (Kotlin);</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In the realm of Android app development, I have lent my creative touch to crafting a diary entry application that seamlessly integrates into the daily lives of users. This project not only showcases my proficiency in app development but also reflects a commitment to enhancing user experiences through intuitive and purposeful design.  </ol>
              
            <li><h3>Digital Art and Design:</h3></li>
            <ol>

                <li>Embarking on a creative odyssey, I have ventured into the realm of digital book writing with a project titled "Celestial Legends." This literary endeavor transcends conventional storytelling, as I weave tales inspired by celestial Greek and Egyptian mythology. Adding a unique twist, I infuse the narratives with a teenage perspective, exploring the vast possibilities of infinite universes.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Each page of "Celestial Legends" unfolds not only through words but also through self-painted artwork. These self-painted illustrations serve as visual companions, enriching the storytelling experience and offering a glimpse into the vivid landscapes of celestial mythology.
